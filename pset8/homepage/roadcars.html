            <h1>#3: Porsche 918 Spyder</h1>
            <img src = "918scaled.jpeg" alt = "918 spyder image" class="center">
            <h2>The Porsche 918 Spyder was originally unveilled as a concept at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. Following interest from highly-valued customers, the board officially approved the 918 Spyder for production. The production variant of the 918 Spyder features a hybrid powertrain, combining a 4.6-litre naturally-aspirated V8 engine derived from the RS Spyder LeMans Prototype, producing a peak power of 608bhp, combined with two electric motors at the front and the rear axle, allowing for all-wheel-drive and full torque vectoring. With the hybrid powertrain, Porsche was able to achieve the best of both worlds. Unlike its competitors, the 918 Spyder can be driven in fully-electric mode, which helps reduce overall emissions, but when needed, the high-revving V8 engine intervenes, producing a loud, but pleasant scream.
            </h2>
            <h1>#2: Porsche 911 GT3</h1>
            <img src = "rs4.0scaled.jpeg" alt = "Porsche GT3 RS 4.0 image" class="center">
            <h2>The Porsche 911 GT3 is a high-performance homologation model of the Porsche 911. It began its life as the 1973 Carrera RS. The term 'GT3' was derived from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) GT3 category. The GT3 was different from the standard carrera counterparts, of which they share minimal parts. For example, the engine of the GT3 series 911 features bespoke parts not uncommonly found on Porsche's race cars, such as titanium connecting rods, forged pistons as well as dry-sump lubrication system, which allows the engine to produce more power and rev higher. The GT3 also features enhanced aerodynamics, improved suspension and damping components, improve brakes and reduced weight by removing non-essential extras.
            </h2>
            <h1>#1: Porsche Carrera GT</h1>
            <img src = "carreragtscaled.jpeg" alt = "carrera gt photo" class="center">
            <h2>The Porsche Carrera GT can be described as a "parts bin" car. Why? The engine was initally planned for the Porsche 911 GT1 prototype programme, and a twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine was initially planned. But that idea was scrapped, in favour for an all-new V10 engine. The V10 engine, displaced at 5.5L was enlarged to 5.7L in the production car, producing a peak power output of 612 metric horsepower, and featured exotic materials for its manufacture. The most impressive trait of the engine isn't its power output nor any other figure. Near the redline, the engine produces a high-pitched howl that is indescribable. Paired with the sole transmission, a six-speed manual gearbox with a reinforced carbon-fibre clutch, makes the Carrera GT, one of the best driver's car ever made. </h2>
