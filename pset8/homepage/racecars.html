            <h1>#3: Porsche 911 GT3 Cup</h1>
            <img src = "Master.jpg" alt = "992 GT3 CUP photo" class="center">
            <h2>The Porsche 911 GT3 Cup has always been one of the best Porsche race cars, built on the already very competent 911 platform since the 996 generation. The cup car shares its underpinnings such as the engine, suspension as well as overall bodywork with the GT3 road car. This results in a fast, yet reliable racecar that amateur drivers can depend on. Since it shares parts with the road car, parts are also inexpensive to replace. The latest iteration of the cup car, based on the 992 generation body, takes advantage of the wider front track and tire width, which enhances overall grip, as well as introduces new double-wishbone front suspension, shared with the 911 RSR. Also new with the 992 based cup car is the turbo body, which adopts new side air inlets which help enhance cooling of the engine. The car also steps up in terms of aerodynamics. The rear wing is mounted higher and positioned further aft of the bodywork, and instead of having the wing struts mounted conventionally on the bottom of the wing plane, the struts go over and is mounted on top of it, effectively like a "swan neck". This minimises the disruption of airflow of the bottom of the car, allowing greater downforce.

            <h1>#2: Porsche RS Spyder</h1>
            <img src = "maxresdefault.jpg" alt = "Porsche RS Spyder photo" class="center">
            <h2>The Porsche RS Spyder was a LeMans Prototype racer, competing in the LMP2 category. It made its debut during the final race of the 2005 American LeMans Series at Laguna Seca. It has since won the ALMS LMP2 category in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Porsche RS Spyder was designed completely in house by Porsche engineers with the aid from Penske Racing. The chassis was based on a rigid carbon fibre monocoque. The engine was a 3.4 litre 90-degree V8 engine paired to a six-speed sequential gearbox. After the life of the RS spyder, many of its innovations were transferred to the Porsche 918 spyder, a plug-in flagship hypercar.

            <h1>#1: Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo</h1>
            <img src = "Porsche-919-Ring-Record-01.jpg" alt = "919 hybrid evo photo" class="center">
            <h2>Following the end of Porsche's LMP program in 2017, Porsche took what's left of the 919 prototype and threw all of the regulations out of the window. The objective was to create the ultimate racing machine, with only one goal: the fastest lap times. In order to maximise performance, Porsche engineers looked at every single component of the car to see if improvements could be made. The first main component that was extensively relooked was the powertrain. Fuel flow limiters were thrown out, maximising the 2-litre engine's power output. In addition, the electrical motors were also tweaked to increase power output, when combined, produces a power output of 1,160 hp. The aerodynamics of the car was also looked at, and one obvious change was the rear wing. The area of the wing has been significantly increased. In addition, there lies the presence of a drag-reduction-system on the wing, which is used to allow the car to propel at greater speeds where downforce is simply not needed. The car also features skirts on the sides to utilise ground effect, something that was forbidden in the rules of the LMP category. Other tweaks that were made into the car was the removal of unessential components, such as the wiper, air-conditioning as well as the headlights. This resulted in an unprecedented lap time in the Nordschleife of 5 minutes and 19 seconds.</h2>
